# SWAPI Homework

# Part the first

Improve the planet-lister page with the following functionalities:

- While we are loading a planet's data show an appropriate loading indicator
- In addition to the names of the planet's residents, show their species in parenthesis
- If a planet does not have any residents, display an appropriate message

# Part the second

Create a page that has a list of all the species in the star wars universe. The list should show *only*  the species that have more than one representative.  
Initially the list should display:

- The id of the species
- The name of the species
- The classification of the species
- The number of people of the species

There should be an button or link in each row, that will enable the user to load the specific people of the species on demand. Once the button is clicked, it should dissapear and be replaced with a loading indicator. Once loading is complete, the names of the people of the species should be displayed.
