# Homework
## Create a Lion class that inherits from Animal and has:
* isKingOfTheJungle - boolean
* huntingSkill - must be from 1 to 10 ( validate on setting this property )
* hunt - a method that checks if the input is an Animal.
	* If the input is an Animal than randomly generate a number from 1 to 10. If the number is equal or less than the huntingSkill of this Lion than try and eat the animal with the eat method.
	* If the Lion is king of the jungle than automatically try and eat the animal no matter the huntingSkill
	* If the number is larger than the huntingSkill then write in the console: The Lion didn't catch it's prey
	* If the input is not an animal write in the console: The Lion can't hunt (the input)

**Note**: 
* name and type of the lion should be added automatically without entering it from the constructor
* hunt method should take 5 seconds before returning a result ( the lion is hunting, it takes time )

## Create a Rabbit class that inherits from Animal and has:
* speed - must be from 1 to 10 ( validate on setting this property )
* size - custom get and set. ( set is normal, get returns the size value multiplied by the speed property. )

## Bonus
* An animal can't eat it self
* An animal can't eat an laready eaten animal
