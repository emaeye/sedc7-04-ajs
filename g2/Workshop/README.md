# Ultimate Space Explorer 3000 üéÆ
## Requirements 
We are tasked in building a space game. In the space game we have an option to choose 3 ships with different stats and go on adventures to planets that will be shown on a galaxy map. Our job is to explore all planets in the universe. But this task will not be easy because we need to manage our ship, fuel and crew to survive this journey. 

### A ship üöÄ
A ship is chosen at the start of the game. That ship will be the vehicle that we travel the galaxy and try to explore every planet. A ship will consist of:
* name - the ship name
* crew - number of crew
* fuel - fuel of the ship
* hull - hull strength of the ship
* speed - speed of the ship  ( 0.1 - 1 )
* credits - currency for buying services ( not settable, 500 by default )
* img - image link or path to an image of the ship
* isWorking - flag if the ship is working or not ( not settable, false by default )
* isDamaged - flag if the ship is damaged or not ( not settable, false by default )
* isDestroyed - flag if the ship is destroyed or not ( not settable, false by default )
* dockedPlanet - the planet on which the ship is docked at ( not settable, null by default )
* start - Method that accepts **a planet** as parameter and will start an exploration to that planet
	* Can't go to something that is not a planet
	* Can't go to a planet that a ship is docked on
	* Can't start if the ship is damaged, destroyed, has no crew or has no fuel to reach the planet
	* isWorking is changed to true
	* **Fuel is is calculated** by this formula: fuel = fuel - (planet distance  *  20);
	* The ship should get to the planet and **dock** in different time span depending on the speed and distance to the planet
	* **Time to get to a planet is calculated** by this formula: planet distance  *  1000ms  /  speed of ship
* dock - method that accepts a planet parameter and is called when a ship needs to dock on a planet
	* Ship is docking on a planet for 2 seconds
	* The ship is added to the dockedShips array of the planet
	* The ship isWorking is changed to false
	* The dockedPlanet property of the ship is changed to the planet
### A planet üåé
A planet is an entity that floats in to space. It is shown on the web page so that the player can click on it and travel to it. When a ship gets on a planet it can either repair, refuel or hire a crew member.
* name - Planet name
* size - Planet size
* population - Planet population
* distance - Planet distance
* shipsDocked - Ships currently docked on the planet ( not settable, empty array by default )
* development - The development level of the planet ( 1 - 3 )
* img - link to an image
* getMarketPrice - method that accepts a price as an attribute of a service and returns the planet market value of that price by this formula : price = planet development * price - Math.floor( planet population / planet size )
* repair - accepts a ship as an attribute and repairs it's hulls to max
	* if the attribute is not a ship, you can't repair it
	* if the ship is not docked on this planet, you can't repair it
	* if the hull is already at max strength you can't repair it
	* if the ship has not enough credits you can't repair it
	* When the ship is repaired it's hull is changed to maximum value, the price is subtracted from the ship credits and the property isDamaged is set to false
* refuel - accepts a ship as an attribute and refuels it's tank to max
	* if the attribute is not a ship, you can't refuel it
	* if the ship is not docked on this planet, you can't refuel it
	* if the fuel is already at max capacity you can't refuel it
	* if the ship has not enough credits you can't refuel it
	* When the ship is refueled it's fuel is changed to maximum value and the price is subtracted from the ship credits
* hireCrewMember - accepts a ship as an attribute and adds one to the crew of the ship
	* if the attribute is not a ship, you can't add a crew member
	* if the ship is not docked on this planet, you can't add a crew member
	* if the ship has not enough credits you can't add a crew member
	* When the ship hires a new crew member it's crew is expanded by 1 and the price is subtracted from the ship credits
