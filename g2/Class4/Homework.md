## Refactoring the countries app and adding new features
The app for countries is in the folder class3. For this homework you need to refactor the code and add new features to it. The new features will be:
* If there are more than 5 results in a search then make a next button  to show the other. ( if there are even more than that there should be next button again until the last countries)
* There should be buttons for filtering the current result:
** Button that only shows the country with largest population from the results
** Button that only shows the largest country by area from the results
* The coulmns population and area should be sortable by number. ( if you click the column title it should sort the countries in ascending order. If you click again it will sort them by descending )
* The columns name and capital shound be sortable by first letter. ( if you click the column title it should sort the countries by the first letter in ascending order. If clicked again it shoud sort the countries in descending.
