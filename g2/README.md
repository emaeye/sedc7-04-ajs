# JavaScript Advanced Group 2 &#x1F4D8;
**This is a subject that is built upon the previous subject JavaScript Basics. The main goal of this course is to get a better understanding of JavaScript and learn some more advanced features that the language has to offer. We will learn the following:**
* Make AJAX calls and get content from JSON response
* An in depth knowledge on functions
* How to write synchronous and asynchronous code
* An in depth knowledge on objects and object oriented JavaScript
* How to use NPM and node.js console

## This Repository
This repository will contain every piece of material about the subject. It will include:
* Materials and documentation for the classes 
* Code that we write on the classes
* Exercises
* Homework
