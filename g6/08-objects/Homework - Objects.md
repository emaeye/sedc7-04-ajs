# HOMEWORK

Write a generic function for populate table

The same function should show whatever data we send,
eather it is people or planets, or maybe vehicles/starships in the future
* You will need to create the title row dynamically also
* Write a constructor function to create an object with only the necessary properties for display

hint:
```JavaScript
Object.keys() // read about the Object.keys()
// It will return us an array of the names of all the keys of the object we send as property
```
